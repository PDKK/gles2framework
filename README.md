# gles2framework

### a simple framework for OpenGLES 2.0 written in C

*** Brief API notes at the end of the readme ***

intended to help learning and tutorial writing

Currently supports XORG (linux) and the raspberry pi (none Xwindows proprietory EGL) on the pi it uses 
X for input so you need to be running xwindows when the executables run

dependencies libpng, libEGL, libGLES (2.0), libode (0.12) for phystest

pkg-config, build-esentials and development libraries must be installed to compile the framework

if you have not compiled GLES source code on your pi before you may need to make a file called

/etc/ld.so.conf.d/vc.conf

it should contain just the line

/opt/vc/lib

the rather hacky ODE example is only really for advanced users... compile ode from source 
(version v0.12) release you can then 

cp ../ode-0.12/ode/src/.libs/libode.a ./libs/ 

from the gles2framework directory

You need it to use dSingle with trimesh support and you might want other things like custom cylinder
vs cylinder colliders etc you won't get from the repo version 

set drawstuff=none for quicker build (no demos etc)

run ./configure --help in the ode directory.

Makefile________tells the compiler how to build the examples

README.md_______this file!

kazmath
there is no need to seperatly compile the kazmath library for your platform kazmath sources are now 
automatically compiled into a static library

All though the source is unchanged I have deleted everthing except the C source and the html 
documentation the full distribution of kazmath is available at https://github.com/Kazade/kazmath


### obj2opengl

In order to create code from OBJ files use this script, ensure you set the output file name to 
something like shape.c

you will have to manually make shape.h it should look something like this

	extern float shapeVerts[];
	extern float shapeTexCoords[];
	extern float shapeNormals[];
	extern unsigned int shapeNumVerts;

in addition you will have to add a rule in the Makefile

this method is depricated you should use a GBO instead...


### makeGBO script

This is a binary file format, a kind of compiled OBJ file which can be used instead of embedding 
your objects in the executable (which can be wasteful in terms of ram) Once the object data is 
passed to the GPU the loaded data its based on is freed from memory...

To make a gbo (Gles Binary Object) file place your wavefront object into the same directory if 
for example the shape is called alien.obj then execute ./makeGBO alien - note the lack of the 
file extension it will output alien.gbo which you can then copy to your resources directory - 
see loadObj command detailed below.

### support routines

int loadPNG(const char *filename);

loads a specified png file returning a GLES texture handle

_____

int makeContext();

creates a native window and sets up a GLES context within it

_____

void closeContext();

closes GLES context and window

_____

GLuint create_shader(const char *filename, GLenum type);

returns a GLES shader handle from a file you must specify what type of shader it is either 
GL_VERTEX_SHADER or GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER

_____

GLuint getShaderLocation(int type, GLuint prog, const char *name);

given a type of shaderAttrib or shaderUniform, a shader program handle and a name for the attrib 
or uniform it returns a location handle

_____

void initGlPrint(int w, int h);

This initialises the resources used by the glPrintf you must supply the windows width and height

_____

void glPrintf(float x, float y, const char *fmt, ...);

this behaves exactly like a normal printf except for the first two parameters which specify the starting coordinate

_____

void swapBuffers();

In order isolate egl and native window handles use this routine instead of eglSwapBuffers

_____

void doEvents();

this should be called once a frame to update the key down boolean array and the mouse information

_____

int* getMouse();

this returns a pointer to an array of 3 ints the first 2 are the x and y mouse position the 3rd int 
is a bit field reflecting the state of the mouse buttons

_____

bool* getKeys();

this is an array of 256 bools, while a key is held down the coresponding bool is true, key values are defined in keys.h

_____

*** deprecated may be removed in later version ***

int createObj(struct obj_t *obj, int numVerts, float verts[], float txVert[], float norms[], char *vertShader, char *fragShader);

pass an empty obj_t struct, the number of vertices and arrays of verts, texture coordinates and 
normals, finally you need to specify the file names for the vert and frag shaders

_____

*** deprecated may be removed in later version ***

int createObjCopyShader(struct obj_t *obj, int numVerts, float verts[], float txVert[], float norms[], struct obj_t *sdrobj);

this allows you to initialise a obj shape but using an existing obj's shader.

_____

void drawObj(struct obj_t *obj, kmMat4 * combined, kmMat4 * mv, kmVec3 lightDir, kmVec3 viewDir);

this draws an obj, you need to supply a combined model, view and projection matrices as well as a 
combined model, view matrix for the lighting, light and view direction vectors are also needed for 
lighting

_____

int getDisplayWidth(); int getDisplayHeight();

returns full screen width and height, for now when not on Raspberry PI the "screen" is fixed to a 
640x480 window

_____

int loadObj(struct obj_t *obj,const char *objFile, char *vert, char *frag);

int loadObjCopyShader(struct obj_t *obj,const char *objFile, struct obj_t *sdrobj);

these are basically the same as their createObj counterparts except the OBJ is loaded from a 
compiled binary wavefront object instead of from embedded data.

_____

void initSprite(int w, int h);

void drawSprite(float x, float y, float w, float h, float a, int tex);

like glPrinf the sprite subsystem must be initialised before use, pass the dimensions of the screen.

when drawing a sprite you specify where you want it (x & y) the size of the sprite (w & h) the rotation (a) and which texture to use (tex)

_____

void setMouseRelative(bool mode);

if mode is true the mouse will report relative position changes only, this is handy for mouse 
look where you dont want the mouse constrained by the window. By default absolute mouse position 
is reported
